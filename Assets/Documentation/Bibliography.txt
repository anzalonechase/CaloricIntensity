Every other Asset used was created by us.



Used fonts: 

The Late Font family, created by Łukasz Dziedzic. This font was used on the About page, as it was more professional and legible, which is what we was going for. 

The SF Pixelate Font, created by Shy Fonts. This font was used widely across my game, with practically all of the text being shown in this font. 

Consulted YouTube videos: 

Brackeys, for character movement and camera. 

"Toon Outlines in Unity URP, Shader Graph Using Sobel Edge Detection! ✔️ 2020.3 | Game Dev Tutorial" by NedMakesGames. This tutorial, I (Joaquin) tried to follow three times, and each time, I found that it was too convoluted and moved too fast. In the end, I just used the Legacy Post-Processing made available from Jean Moreno. If you would like to be similarly confounded by this video, you can access it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMt6DcaMxcE.
