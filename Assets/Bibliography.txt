Used fonts: 

The Late Font family, created by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic. This font was used on the About page, as it was more professional and legible, which is what I was going for. 

The SF Pixelate Font, created by Shy Fonts. This font was used widely across my game, with practically all of the text being shown in this font.
