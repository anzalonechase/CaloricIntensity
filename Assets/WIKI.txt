Character Create:

-Color (This will set HUD a certain color)
-Difficulty level (This will adjust the time the player has and how many customer orders they must fulfill)


Objective:
The objective of the game is to satisfy all of the orders the player is required to satisfy before the time runs out. The orders the NPCs display are random, if not careful, the player might waste ammo and will be forced to run back to the "shop" to reload ammo which will cost them time. The order must be completed before time runs out.

Instructions:
The player will spawn in front of the shop the character works at. They must run around the map looking for the customers and their orders. They will then have to shoot their blaster to satisfy their orders. Beware that missing the customer will simply result in a waste of ammo that might become a massive mistake. The difficulty level dictates the time the player has to complete the objective and how many orders they must fulfill.

Easy: 4 minutes (240 seconds), 8 customers  
Medium: 3.5 minutes (210 seconds), 10 customers  
Easy: 3 minutes (180 seconds), 12 customers
